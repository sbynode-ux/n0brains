## The Short Answer

All three majors are trading **below their London session opens** — a bearish intraday signal suggesting European selling pressure hasn't been absorbed.

## Session-by-Session Prices

| Session | BTC | ETH | SOL |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|
| Tokyo | $86,160 | $2,753 | $118.51 |
| London | $86,145 | $2,743 | $117.97 |
| New York | $86,074 | $2,744 | $117.18 |
| **Current** | **$85,538** | **$2,722** | **$116.92** |

## What This Means

**Session flow analysis** tracks how prices move across the three major trading sessions:

- **Tokyo (Asian session)**: Sets the overnight tone. Often driven by Asian institutional flow and weekend gap fills.
- **London (European session)**: The highest-volume session. Where the "smart money" typically positions.
- **New York (US session)**: Where retail and institutional US flow enters. Often determines the daily close.

When all three assets are trading below London opens, it signals that European sellers are in control and US buyers haven't stepped in to absorb the selling. The opposite (trading above London) signals sustained buying pressure.

## Key Levels to Watch

- **BTC**: Current $85,538 — watch for a reclaim of the London open at $86,145
- **ETH**: Current $2,722 — watch for a reclaim of the London open at $2,743
- **SOL**: Current $116.92 — watch for a reclaim of the London open at $117.97
